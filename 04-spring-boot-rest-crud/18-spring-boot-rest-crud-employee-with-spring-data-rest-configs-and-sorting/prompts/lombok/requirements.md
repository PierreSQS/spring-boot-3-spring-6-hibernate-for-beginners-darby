# Lombok Integration Requirements

## Objective
Integrate Project Lombok into the Spring Boot application to reduce boilerplate code in entity classes, improving code readability and maintainability.

## Background
The current project contains an `Employee` entity class with standard boilerplate code including getters, setters, constructors, and a toString method. Lombok can automatically generate this code at compile time through annotations, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Requirements

### 1. Dependencies and Configuration
- Add the Lombok dependency to the project's `pom.xml` file:
  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
      <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
      <optional>true</optional>
  </dependency>
  ```

- Configure the Maven compiler plugin to enable annotation processing for Lombok. Since the project is using Spring Boot 3.5.0 with Java 17, use the following configuration:
  ```xml
  <plugin>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <configuration>
          <excludes>
              <exclude>
                  <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
                  <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
              </exclude>
          </excludes>
      </configuration>
  </plugin>
  ```

- Note: Spring Boot's parent POM already manages the Lombok version, so you don't need to specify it explicitly. The `<optional>true</optional>` setting ensures that Lombok won't be transitively included in projects that depend on this one.

### 2. Entity Class Refactoring
- Refactor the `Employee` entity class by applying the following Lombok annotations:
  - `@Getter`: To generate getters for all fields
  - `@Setter`: To generate setters for all fields
  - `@NoArgsConstructor`: To generate a default constructor
  - `@AllArgsConstructor`: To generate a constructor with all fields
  - `@ToString`: To generate the `toString()` method
  - `@EqualsAndHashCode`: To generate `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods (if needed)
  - Consider using `@Data` as a shorthand for `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, and `@RequiredArgsConstructor`

- Example implementation of the refactored `Employee` class:
  ```java
  package com.luv2code.springboot.cruddemo.entity;

  import jakarta.persistence.*;
  import lombok.*;

  @Entity
  @Table(name="employee")
  @Getter
  @Setter
  @NoArgsConstructor
  @ToString
  public class Employee {
      @Id
      @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
      @Column(name="id")
      private int id;

      @Column(name="first_name")
      private String firstName;

      @Column(name="last_name")
      private String lastName;

      @Column(name="email")
      private String email;

      // Custom constructor for creating an employee without ID
      public Employee(String firstName, String lastName, String email) {
          this.firstName = firstName;
          this.lastName = lastName;
          this.email = email;
      }
  }
  ```

- Note that we've kept the custom constructor that takes firstName, lastName, and email parameters, as this is used in the existing code. The `@AllArgsConstructor` is not used here to avoid conflicts with this custom constructor.

### 3. Implementation Guidelines
- Ensure that JPA annotations are preserved when applying Lombok annotations
- Remove all manually written boilerplate code (getters, setters, constructors, toString) that will be generated by Lombok
- Maintain the same functionality and behavior of the entity class
- Ensure that the entity class remains compatible with existing code that uses it

### 4. IDE Configuration
- Ensure that the IDE is configured to recognize Lombok annotations:
  - For IntelliJ IDEA: Install the Lombok plugin and enable annotation processing
  - For Eclipse: Install the Lombok plugin
  - For VS Code: Install the Lombok Annotations Support extension

### 5. Testing
- Verify that the application builds successfully after implementing Lombok
- Run existing tests to ensure that the functionality remains the same
- Manually test the application to ensure that the entity class behaves as expected

### 6. Best Practices for Lombok Usage
- Use Lombok annotations judiciously and consistently across the codebase
- Be aware of potential issues with serialization frameworks and adjust accordingly
- Consider using `@Builder` for complex object creation patterns if needed in the future
- Document any custom behavior that might not be obvious from the annotations
- When using `@EqualsAndHashCode`, consider specifying which fields to include/exclude
- For JPA entities, be cautious with `@EqualsAndHashCode` to avoid issues with lazy loading
- Prefer individual annotations (`@Getter`, `@Setter`, etc.) over `@Data` when you need fine-grained control

## Success Criteria
- The application builds successfully with Lombok integrated
- The `Employee` entity class has reduced boilerplate code through Lombok annotations
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Code is more maintainable and readable
- Tests pass successfully after the refactoring
